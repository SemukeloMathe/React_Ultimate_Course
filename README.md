# ðŸ“˜ The Ultimate React Course 2025

This repository contains my notes, code and projects from [The Ultimate React Course 2025](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/). 
It's a comprehensive course designed to take learners from React `fundamentals` to `advanced` concepts. This course emphasizes hands-on learning, guiding you through the creation of multiple real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Learning

* **React Fundamentals**: Understanding `JSX`, `components`, `props`, `state`, and the `virtual DOM`.

* **Advanced React Concepts**: Mastering hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and building custom hooks.

* **State Management**: Implementing global and local state management using `Context API` and `Redux`.

* **Routing**: Navigating single-page applications with `React Router`, including data loading techniques.

* **Performance Optimization**: Utilizing `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and code splitting for efficient applications.

* **Next.js Integration**: Exploring server-side rendering and building full-stack applications with `Next.js`.

* **Form Handling**: Managing and validating forms effectively within React applications.

* **API Integration**: Fetching and managing data from RESTful APIs using `Axios` and `React Query`.

* **Authentication**: Implementing user authentication flows with `JSON Web Tokens (JWT)`.

* **Deployment**: Preparing and deploying React applications to production environments.
