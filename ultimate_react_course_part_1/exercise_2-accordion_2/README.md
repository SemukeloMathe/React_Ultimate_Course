# Execrsise 3 - Accordion Element

In this exercise we experiment with a popular UI element that shows a list of expandable cards in a real world scenario.
Each time a card is clicked it expands and reveals more text based on that card topic.
We use State to conditionally add class names to the styling aswell as display element content.
Once the card is clicked the title element changes color aswell as a border appears on top.
This exercise tests your understanding of thinking in React.

The following React concepts are explored in this exercise:

- Resuing Components
- State
- JSX
- Styling in React
- List Rendering
- Conditional Rendering
- Props
- Children Prop
