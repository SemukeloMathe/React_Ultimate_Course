# Challenge 2 - Advanced Developer Card

- This challenge is meant to demonstrate the developer's skills in understanding the basics of React fundamentals, which is rendering lists in react using the JavaScript map method, creating and re-using a function component, and passing props and using props.
- We also conditionally render the emoji displayed on the skills list based on the level of understanding thats captured in the _skills_ array.
- And lastly we set the background color by using the color displayed in the _skills_ array.

The React concepts exlored in this challenge are:

1. Components
