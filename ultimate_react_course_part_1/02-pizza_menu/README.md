# Pizza Menu App

This project touches on the the following React Concepts:

## 1. Components

- React applications are entirely made out of components.
- They are the building blocks of User Interfaces in React.
- It is a piece of UI that has it's own data, logic, and appearance.
- We build complex UIs by building multiple component and combining them.
- Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them.
- A component tree shows the hierachy that exists to show the components used.
- When creating new components in react, we are obliged to use the following criteria:
- 1. The component must be a function that starts with an uppercase letter.
- 2. The function needs to return some mark up, usually in jsx but you can also return null.
- 3. Each component needs to return one element.
- 4. Never function component declarations, but always declare all your components in the top level.
- 5. Use _fragments_ to render multiple components on the same element.

## 2. Props

## 3. JSX

- A _declarative syntax_ to describe what components look like and how they work.
- Components must return a block of JSX.
- It is also an extension of JavaScript that allows us to _embed_ _JavaScript_, _CSS_, and _React components_ into _HTML_.
- Each JSX element is converted to a _React.createElement_ function call.
- We could use React without _JSX_.
- JSX combines JavaScript, CSS, and HTML into one single block.

## 4. Re-using components

## 5. Rendering Lists

## 6. Conditional Rendering

## Key Notes

React is an _abstraction_ away from the DOM, _We never touch the DOM_
