# Children Prop

- The _Children Prop_ is a prop that each React component automatically receives.
- The value of the children prop is exactly what is between the opening and closing tag of that component.
- To access those values we use the _children_ keyword.
- It enables you to pass JSX into an elemnt besides regular props.
- It is an _essential tool_ to make _reusable_ and _configurable_ components.
- Really useful for _generic_ components that don't know their content before being used (e.g modal);
