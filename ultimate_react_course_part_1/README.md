# Part 1 - React Fundamentals & Concepts.

## Why do Frontend Frameworks exist?

- They exist because keeping a UI in sync with data is really hard and it is a lot of work.
- Frontend frameworks solve this problem and take hard work away from developers.
- They enforce a correct way of structuring and writing code, solving the spaghetti code problem.
- They give developers and teams a consistent way of building front-end applications.

## What is REACT

- A JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces.
- It is an _Extremely Popular_, _Declarative_, _Component-based_, _State-Driven_ JavaScript Library for building _User-Interfaces_, created by FaceBook.

### 1. Based on Components

- _Components_ are the _building blocks_ of user interfaces in _React_.
- We build complex UIs by building and _combining multiple components_.

### 2. Declarative

- We _describe_ how _components_ look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called _JSX_.
- _Declarative_ is telling React what a component should look like, based on current data/state.
- _React_ is _abstraction_ away from the DOM, we _never toch the DOM_.
- _JSX_ is a syntax that combines _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavaScript_ as well as referencing _other created components_.

### 3. State-Driven

- _React_ reacts to _state changes_ by _re-rendering_ the UI.

## Is React a JavaScript Library or Framework?

- React is a library, because it is only the view layer.
- We need to pick multiple external libraries to build a complete application.

## React is really good at two things.

- 1. Renedering components on a webpage (UI) based on their current state.
- 2. Keeping the UI in sync with state, by re-rendering (reacting) when state changes.

## What is a React Framework?

- It is a framework built ontop of the React Library.
- Which makes it even easier to build applications.
