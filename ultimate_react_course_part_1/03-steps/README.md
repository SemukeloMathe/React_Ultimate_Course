# Steps App

This project is a simple introduction on how we use _State_ in react.

## Handling events in React

- We directly listen on the element the event will happen on.
- It's really important to specify a function.
- We want to define a callback function that will be executed when the awaited event occurs, for example a mouse click event.

## What is State?

- Data that a component _can hold over time_.
- It is basically a _Component's memory_.
